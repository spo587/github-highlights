# Sight reading page
This [website](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/95890750/vexflow_sightreading/home.html) is an ongoing project that generates and displays music (in the form of sight reading exercises for piano) in a web browser using the Vexflow Javascript library, developed in part with a faculty grant from Levine Music.

Different levels use different algorithms for generating music. Level three uses a variable neighborhood search (VNS) which adapts a few simple counterpoint rules to generate melodic sequences that minimize an objective function after coming up with initially random sequences.

Other algorithms in progress include hierarchical structures, a VNS for rhythms, and other combinations of different techniques.
